## Introduction

For most of today, I'll present some slides and ask you to follow some (hopefully) simple instructions.
The first set of slides are available [here](1.1.1_Introduction.html).

The second set of slides is [here](1.1.2_DataImport.html) and additional data for this session is available at [this link](assets/toothData.csv).
Please download this file and place it in the `data` subdirectory of your `R_Training` project.
(We'll create this during the first half of the session)
The name of the file should be kept as `toothData.csv`

The final file we need for this session is some example [RT-PCR data](assets/RealTimeData.xlsx).
Please download and place in the same `data` folder.
