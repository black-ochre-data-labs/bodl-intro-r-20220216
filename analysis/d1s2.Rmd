## Introduction

Now we've learned how to parse files, let's move to a more challenging file and learn how to deal with some common difficulties.
Hopefully you won't see too many of these issues in BODL data files.

### Data Files

We'll discuss during our very first session but we'll need to create a directory on our computer before we start.
We should name this `R_Training` and whatever your OS version of `Documents` is might be a good place for it.
Inside that directory, please create a new directory called data and the following files can be placed in this folder

- [transport.csv](data/transport.csv).

### Slides

For most of today, I'll present some slides and ask you to follow some (hopefully) simple instructions.

- The first set of slides are available [here](1.2.1_LoadingDifficultData.html)

If you want to follow along, please open these in a new browser tab/window but it might just be easier to follow mine
