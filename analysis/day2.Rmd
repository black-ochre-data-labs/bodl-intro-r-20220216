## Introduction

Yesterday was an applied look at working with data in `R`.
Today we'll still be very applied, but we'll begin to explore some of the more technical aspects to understanding data in `R`

### Data Files

We'll continue working with the same files as Day 1

## Slides

For most of today, I'll present some slides and ask you to follow some (hopefully) simple instructions.
If you want to follow along, please open these in a new browser tab/window but it might just be easier to follow mine and leave your RStudio session as the main focus

### Session 1

- [Understanding Data Types](2.1_DataTypes.html)

### Session 2

- [Working With Text](2.2_TextManipulation.html)
