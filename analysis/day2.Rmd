## Introduction

Yesterday was an applied look at working with data in `R`.
Today we'll still be very applied, but we'll begin to explore some of the more technical aspects to understanding data in `R`

### Data Files

We'll continue working with the same files as Day 1, with one further addition

- [geneExpression.csv](data/geneExpression.csv)

The cleaned-up version of transport is also here to make things easier

- [transport_clean.csv](data/transport_clean.csv)
