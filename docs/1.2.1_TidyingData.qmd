# Logical Tests {background-color="#3c3c44"}

## Logical Tests

- Before we start to dig too deep $\implies$ **Logical Tests**

. . .

- We also need another sneak peak at vectors

## The `c()` Function

- The `c()` function joins values together
- Commonly thought to stand for `combine` or `concatenate`

```{r}
c()
1:3
c(1, 2, 3)
x <- c(1:5, NA)
```

## Logical Tests 

::: {.incremental}

- Is Equal To: `==`
- Not equal: `!=`
- Or: `|`
- Less than: `<`
- Less than or equal: `<=`

:::

## Logical Tests

```{r, results='hide'}
x == 5
x != 5
x > 3
x > 3 | x == 2
is.na(x)
```

- `R` also recognises the symbol `&` for `AND`


# Data Manipulation {background-color="#3c3c44"}

## Data Manipulation

Also known as _data munging_

We'll cover:

- `SQL-` and `Excel-`like functions in `dplyr`
- Changing from wide to long form using `tidyr`
<!-- - Editing text using `stringr` -->

## Loading The Packages

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

- The package `dplyr` works specifically with `data.frame` objects
- Works optimally with `tibble`-style data.frames

# The package `dplyr` {background-color="#3c3c44" background-image=https://swag.rstudio.com/uploads/1/3/1/3/131335021/s815253891256106552_p2_i4_w660.png}

## Starting with `dplyr`

Data for this session

```{r load-transport}
transport <- read_csv(
  "data/transport.csv",
  comment = "#", col_names = FALSE, na = "-", col_types = "-ccnnc"
)
colnames(transport) <- c("gender", "name", "weight", "height", "method")
```

. . .

So we have a `r nrow(transport)` x `r ncol(transport)` `data frame`

```{r, results='hide'}
dim(transport)
nrow(transport)
ncol(transport)
```

## Starting with `dplyr::select()` 

- The function `select()` allows you to select columns by name
- The `tibble` must be given as the first argument

```{r}
select(transport, gender, name, weight)
```

Or by position

```{r}
select(transport, 1:3)
```

## Starting with `dplyr::select()` 

- We can also remove columns using the minus (`-`) sign

```{r}
select(transport, -2)
select(transport, -name)
```

__Discuss: Would removing by name or position by the best?__

## Starting with `dplyr::select()` 

The `select()` function has a few helper functions

- `starts_with()`, `ends_with()`, `contains()`, `one_of()`, `any_of()`, `all_of()` and `everything()`
- Provided in the package `tidyselect` (always loaded by `dplyr`)

```{r}
select(transport, ends_with("ght"))
select(transport, contains("t"))
```

## Starting with `dplyr::select()` 

__So far, we haven't changed the original object__

We can overwrite this anytime (sometimes we will by accident)

```{r}
transport <- select(transport, -name)
transport
```

Now we have removed the `name` column

## Starting with `dplyr::select()` 

- To get the column back, we need to reload the `.csv` file

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
transport <- read_csv(
  "data/transport.csv",
  comment = "#", col_names = FALSE, na = "-", col_types = "-ccnnc"
)
colnames(transport) <- c("gender", "name", "weight", "height", "method")
```


## Using `dplyr::filter()` 

- We can use our logical tests to filter the data
- Again we need to specify the `tibble` as the first argument

```{r}
filter(transport, method == "car")
filter(transport, method == "car", gender == "female")
```

## Using `dplyr::arrange()` 

We can sort on one or more columns

```{r}
arrange(transport, weight)
arrange(transport, method, height)
```

We can change to descending order using `desc()`

```{r}
arrange(transport, desc(weight))
```

# Combining Functions {background-color="#3c3c44"}

## Combining Functions

- This is where `dplyr` steps up a gear
- We can chain functions together using `|>`
- This behaves like a `|` in the bash shell
- Introduced as `%>%` from the package `magrittr`
    + Added to R 4.2.0

Places the **output of the first function** as the **first argument** of the next function!

## Combining Functions

```{r}
filter(transport, method == "bike")
```

Is identical to 

```{r}
transport |> filter(method == "bike")
```

## Combining Functions

But now we can perform multiple operations!

```{r}
transport |> filter(method == "bike") |> arrange(weight)
```

There is __no limit__ to the number of functions you can chain together

## For the technically minded

1. Each function in `dplyr` takes a `data.frame` as the first argument
2. Each function returns a `data.frame`

```{r}
transport |> filter(method == "bike") |> arrange(weight)
```


1. The `|>` placed `transport` into the first argument of `filter()`
2. The output of `filter()` was a `data.frame` $\implies$ this was placed as the first argument to `arrange()`


## Using `dplyr::mutate()`

We can add extra columns using `mutate()`

```{r}
transport |> mutate(height_m = height/100)
```

Once we've added a column, we can refer to it by name

```{r}
transport |> 
  mutate(
    height_m = height/100, 
    BMI = weight / height_m^2
  )
```

## Using `dplyr::mutate()`

We can also overwrite existing columns

```{r}
transport |> mutate(height = height/100)
```

__Have we changed the original__ `data_frame` yet?

## Using `dplyr::rename()`

Can use the function `rename()`

```{r}
transport |> rename(height_cm = height)
```

Now we can get crazy

```{r}
transport |>
  rename(height_cm = height) |>
  mutate(height_m = height_cm/100, BMI = weight / height_m^2) |>
  filter(BMI > 25)
```

## Getting Summaries

We can get summaries for entire columns

```{r}
transport |> 
  summarise(mean(weight), mean(height))
```

## Getting Summaries

Let's remove that missing value:

```{r}
transport |>
  filter(!is.na(height)) |>
  summarise(mean(weight), mean(height))
```

## Getting Summaries

We can group categorical variables by their levels

```{r}
transport |>
  filter(!is.na(height)) |>
  group_by(gender) |>
  summarise(mean(weight), mean(height))
```


## Getting Group Summaries

Or combinations of levels

```{r}
transport |>
  filter(!is.na(height)) |>
  group_by(gender, method) |>
  summarise(mean(weight), mean(height))
```

We can use any function that spits out a single value

- `sd()`, `min()`, `median()`

## Getting Group Summaries

We could assign our own names to the columns

```{r}
transport |>
  filter(!is.na(height)) |>
  group_by(gender, method) |>
  summarise(
    mn_weight = mean(weight), 
    mn_height = mean(height)
  )
```

## Getting Group Summaries

And we can count how many entries we have using `n()`

```{r}
transport |>
  filter(!is.na(height)) |>
  group_by(gender, method) |>
  summarise(
    mn_weight = mean(weight), 
    mn_height = mean(height), 
    n = n()
  )
```

# Applying Functions Across Multiple Columns {background-color="#3c3c44"}

## Applying Functions Across Multiple Columns

- Use the helper function `across()`
- Can apply `starts_with()`, `ends_with()`, `contains()` syntax to select variables/columns
- Pass a function to the `.fns` argument
    
## Applying Functions Across Multiple Columns

```{r}
transport |>
  filter(!is.na(height)) |>
  group_by(gender, method) |>
  summarise(
    across(.cols = ends_with("ght"), .fns = mean)
  )
```

## Applying Multiple Functions

We can pass multiple functions to multiple columns

```{r}
transport |>
  filter(!is.na(height)) |>
  group_by(gender, method) |>
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    across(ends_with("ght"), .fns = c(mn = mean, sd = sd))
  )
```

## Applying Multiple Functions

We can also pass function arguments

```{r}
transport |>
  group_by(gender, method) |>
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    across(ends_with("ght"), .fns = c(mn = mean, sd = sd), na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

## Using `dplyr::case_when()`

Kalen just had her height measured and she is 158.1cm. That missing value can be fixed!!!

```{r}
transport |>
  mutate(
    height = case_when(
      name == "Kalen" ~ 158.1,
      name != "Kalen" ~ height
    )
  )
```

. . .

- `case_when()` is like `if_else()` but allows for multiple options
- e.g. `logFC > 0 & p < 0.05 ~ "Up"` then `logFC < 0 & p < 0.05 ~ "Down"` then `p >= 0.05 ~ "Unchanged"`


## Using `dplyr::case_when()`

Let's overwrite that initial object

```{r}
transport <- transport |>
  mutate(
    height = case_when(
      name == "Kalen" ~ 158.1,
      name != "Kalen" ~ height
    )
  )
```

**What would happen if we accidentally ran this again?**

# Combining Data Frames {background-color="#3c3c44"}

## Combining Data Frames

`dplyr` has some very useful functions for combining `data.frame` objects: `bind_rows()`, `left_join()`, `right_join()` and `full_join()`

Unbelievably, we've just had data from `Tony` and he's a 83kg car-driver, who is 177.3cm tall.

We can manually create a `data_frame` for him

## Combining Data Frames

```{r}
tony <- tibble(
  gender = "male",
  name = "Tony",
  weight = 83,
  height = 177.3,
  method = "car"
)
```

We can add his data using `bind_rows()`

```{r}
bind_rows(tony, transport)
```


## Combining Data Frames

1. Download the object `contacts.csv` to your data folder
2. Load the contact numbers in the file `contacts.csv`

```{r}
contacts <- read_csv("data/contacts.csv", col_types = "cc")
dim(contacts)
dim(transport)
glimpse(contacts)
```


## Combining Data Frames {.build}

**Do these objects look compatible?**

- Some may be missing in one of the objects
- The values in the `name` column look similar
- In a different order

**How do we combine these?**    

## Combining Data Frames | `left_join()`

We can use the first `data_frame` as the template

```{r}
left_join(transport, contacts, by = "name")
```

- Any `name` entries missing from the second object (`contacts`) will become a missing value in the column `contact`
- Any `name` entries in the first which have multiple matches in the second will be expanded

## Combining Data Frames | `right_join()`

We can use the second object as the template

```{r}
right_join(transport, contacts, by = "name")
```

Any missing from the first object (`data`) will become a row of missing values where missing

```{r}
right_join(transport, contacts, by = "name") |> tail()
```


## Combining Data Frames | `full_join()`

Or we can combine everything

```{r}
full_join(transport, contacts, by = "name")
```

Will be missing values in both directions

```{r}
full_join(transport, contacts, by = "name") |> filter(is.na(gender))
full_join(transport, contacts, by = "name") |> filter(is.na(contact))
```


# Reshaping your data {background-color="#3c3c44"}

## Reshaping your data

- This dataset is in what we refer to as `wide` form
- We have a row of measurements for each individual
- The information is _structured around the individual_

In `long` form, the information is _structured around the measurement_

## Reshaping your data | From Wide to Long

```{r}
wideData <- read_csv("data/wide.csv")
wideData
```

This is a time course:

- Measuring log-change in GFP intensity
- Two treatments (`Tx`) A & B 
- Also have identifier columns


## From Wide to Long

The basic function is `gather()`

- Part of the core tidyverse package `tidyr`
- Key arguments are:
    - `key`: what are the column names describing
    - `value`: what is the value in these columns
- Select columns to `gather` using `dplyr` helper functions
    
## From Wide to Long

```{r}
wideData |>
  gather(key = "Day",
         value = "Change",
         contains("day"))
```

Many functions require data to be in this format

## From Wide to Long

__How could we get means for each treatment/day from the original data?__

## From Wide to Long

__How could we get means for each treatment/day from the original data?__

```{r}
wideData |>
  gather(key = "Day",
         value = "Change",
         contains("day")) |>
  group_by(Tx, Day) |>
  summarise(mn_change = mean(Change))
```

Might be easier if needing more summaries (e.g. `sd()`)

## Reshaping your data | From Long To Wide

Let's save that last summary `data.frame`

```{r}
wideMeans <- wideData |>
  gather(key = "Day",
         value = "Change",
         contains("day")) |>
  group_by(Tx, Day) |>
  summarise(mn_change = mean(Change))
```

## From Long To Wide

We can change from long to wide using the 'opposite' function `spread()`

- Values in the `key =` column become the new column names
- Values in the `value =` column remain the values

```{r}
wideMeans |>
  spread(key = Day,
         value = mn_change)
```


## From Long To Wide

Would we ever use both `gather()` and `spread()`?

```{r}
pcr <- read_csv("data/PCR.csv")
head(pcr)
```

Here we have 3 genes being measured in 2 cell types, across 3 time-points

## From Long To Wide

The first part is easy:

```{r}
pcr |>
  gather(key = CellType,
         value = Ct,
         ends_with("hr"))
```

If we want to now organise by treatment and timepoint:

- Need to separate `CellType` into two columns


## From Long To Wide

We can use the function `separate()` 

```{r}
pcr |>
  gather(key = CellType,
         value = Ct,
         ends_with("hr")) |>
  separate(col = CellType, 
           into = c("CellType", "TimePoint"))
```

## From Long To Wide

Now we can form our final data structure

```{r}
pcr |>
  gather(key = CellType,
         value = Ct,
         ends_with("hr")) |>
  separate(col = CellType, 
           into = c("CellType", "TimePoint")) |>
  spread(key = TimePoint,
         value = Ct)
```



<!-- ## Text Manipulation | Returning to our data -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- pcr_long <- pcr |> -->
<!--  gather(key = CellType, -->
<!--          value = Ct, -->
<!--          ends_with("hr")) |> -->
<!--   mutate(TimePoint = str_extract(CellType, "(0hr|12hr|24hr)"), -->
<!--          CellType = str_replace(CellType, "_(0hr|12hr|24hr)", "")) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Save this as `pcr_long` -->

<!-- ## Text Manipulation -->

<!-- Now we could make it wide (but not as wide) -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- pcr_long |> -->
<!--  spread(key = TimePoint, value = Ct) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Challenge -->

<!-- To investigate the effect of fitness, gender, country of origin on red blood cell count (RBC), download `challenge.csv` with observations made on 500 subjects. The variables are: -->

<!-- 1. **gender**: male or female. -->
<!-- 2. **fitness**: a measure of fitness lying between 0 and 100. -->
<!-- 3. **country**: there are three countries denoted by 1, 2, or 3. -->
<!-- 4. **RBC**: red blood cell count in millions/$\mu$L. -->

<!-- __Clean the data entirely in R__ -->
